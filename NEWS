   * Automatically set the common period of predictand and predictor objects in to calibrate the bias correction method
   * Use single station data as predictands
* New miscelaneous functions:
   * getIntersect: sets the common period of two downscaleR objects
   * subsetField: select an arbitrary spatial/temporal subset from a field or multifield
* Minor bug fix in bias correction of precipitation
