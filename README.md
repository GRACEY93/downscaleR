downscaleR
==========

**downscaleR** is an R package for climate analysis, with a special focus on empirical-statistical downscaling of daily data. Find out more about this package at the [downscaleR wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR/wiki). `downscaleR` relies on the capabilities of the [`loadeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) package for data access and manipulation.

The recommended installation procedure is to use the `install_github` command from the devtools R package. 

```R
ï¿¼devtools::install_github(c("SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.java",
                           "SantanderMetGroup/loadeR",
                           "SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR"))
```

Should you experience installation problems (most likely related to your R-java configuration settings), please refer to the `loadeR` [wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/wiki).
