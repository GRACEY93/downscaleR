downscaleR
==========

**downscaleR** is an R package for climate data access and analysis, with a special focus on empirical-statistical downscaling of daily data. Find out more about this package at the [downscaleR wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR/wiki).

The recommended installation procedure is to use the `install_github` command from the devtools R package. 
```R
ï¿¼devtools::install_github(c("SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR.java","SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR"))
```
Note that the auxiliary package `downscaleR.java` is first installed. It contains the netCDF-Java API internally used by `downscaleR`.
